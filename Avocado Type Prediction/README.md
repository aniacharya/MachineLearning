This project primarily focuses on predictin the type of avocado as either conventional or organic, based on several attributes such as average price, total volume, total bags of yield, small bags, large bags, extra large bags, year of yield, sales of three different varities such as PLU4046, PLU4225, PLU4770 and the region in which it is grown. 

Here, the alogorithms used to classify the type of avocado are Logestic regression, Decission trees and Random.

Second part of the project involves the price prediction usinf linear regression.

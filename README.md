Machine Learning is a latest **buzzword** floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.

**What does Machine Learning really means?**
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

**Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.

The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

**Exploratory Data Analysis** refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

#### 1. Breast Cancer Survival

This EDA is to analyse the survival rate of patients who have been detected with Breast cancer. Major paremeter in consideration are,
- Age of patient at time of operation. 
- Patient's year of operation. 
- Number of positive axillary nodes detected. 
- Survival status.
